## Assignment 1: Review of Essential ML Concepts

The first assignment focuses on reviewing essential machine learning concepts, serving as a foundational exercise to ensure a strong understanding of core principles and techniques used in machine learning. It includes theoretical questions and practical coding tasks covering decision trees, PCA, and classification problems using datasets like MNIST and the Heart Disease Dataset.

## Assignment 2: Neural Networks, Optimization, Regression

This assignment covers building neural networks, optimization, and regression. It includes theoretical questions on neural network convergence and coding tasks such as implementing fully connected neural networks and a novel "forward-forward propagation" algorithm, tested on the MNIST dataset.

## Assignment 3: Convolutional Neural Networks

This assignment focuses on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision tasks. It covers theory and coding sections, including topics like CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet), advanced techniques such as deformable convolutions, and change detection between images. Theoretical questions explore concepts like Densely Connected CNNs and U-Net, while coding tasks involve implementing and evaluating models on datasets like CIFAR-10.

## Assignment 4: RNNs, LSTM, VAEs, AEs, GPT2

This assignment covers a diverse range of deep learning models, including RNNs, LSTM, autoencoders, and GPT2. Tasks include applying LSTM and BiLSTM to molecular strings, implementing Variational Autoencoders on MNIST, fine-tuning GPT2 on poetry generation, and testing Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders on MNIST and its color version.

## Project: GAN-BERT

The GAN-BERT project focuses on text classification using a GAN-BERT model on the SemEval-2024 dataset. It involves training a BERT classifier on labeled data and then integrating a GAN architecture for text classification. The GAN-BERT model consists of a Discriminator and Generator, trained adversarially alongside the BERT model.
