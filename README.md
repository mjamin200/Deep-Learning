## Assignment 1: Review of Essential ML Concepts

The first assignment for this course is focused on reviewing essential machine learning concepts. It serves as a foundational exercise to ensure a strong understanding of the core principles and techniques used in machine learning.

In this assignment, I have completed a series of theoretical questions and practical coding tasks. The coding tasks cover topics such as implementing decision trees, dimensionality reduction with PCA, and solving classification problems using various algorithms. The datasets used include MNIST and the Heart Disease Dataset.
