## Assignment 1: Review of Essential ML Concepts

The first assignment for this course is focused on reviewing essential machine learning concepts. It serves as a foundational exercise to ensure a strong understanding of the core principles and techniques used in machine learning.

In this assignment, I have completed a series of theoretical questions and practical coding tasks. The coding tasks cover topics such as implementing decision trees, dimensionality reduction with PCA, and solving classification problems using various algorithms. The datasets used include MNIST and the Heart Disease Dataset.

## Assignment 2: Neural Networks, Optimization, Regression
This exercise covers building neural networks, optimization, and regression. It includes theoretical questions on neural network convergence and coding tasks like implementing fully connected neural networks and a novel "forward-forward propagation" algorithm, testing them on the MNIST dataset, and analyzing accuracy.

## Assignment 3: Convolutional Neural Networks
This exercise focuses on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision tasks, covering theory and coding sections. The topics include CNN architectures like ResNet, advanced techniques such as deformable convolutions, and change detection between images. Theoretical questions explore concepts like Densely Connected CNNs, U-Net, skip connections in ResNet, and deformable convolutions. Coding tasks involve implementing and evaluating ResNet-50 on CIFAR-10, building deformable convolutional networks, and detecting changes between image pairs using CNN models. Each task includes details on datasets, model architectures, training procedures, and analyses.


## Assignment 4: RNNs,LSTM,VAEs,AEs,GPT2
This exercise covered a diverse range of deep learning models, including RNN, BiLSTM, LSTM, autoencoder, and sequence-to-sequence models, in four distinct questions.

The initial investigation applied LSTM, BiLSTM, and FC models to molecular strings (SMIELS), evaluating their accuracy at varying string lengths. The second question implemented Convolutional Variational Autoencoder and Variational Autoencoder networks on the MNIST dataset, focusing on the examination of the latent layer's output, particularly in the case of two dimensions. Moving on, the third question involved fine-tuning the HooshvareLab/gpt2-fa model on Ferdowsi's poems, resulting in the generation of poetic samples. Finally, the fourth question implemented Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders, testing the model on both the MNIST dataset and its color version while exploring variations in codebook vectors.

## Project: GAN-BERT
This project presents a GAN-BERT model for text classification on the SemEval-2024 dataset, aiming to classify text into six classes. Initially, a BERT classifier is trained on labeled data, utilizing an adapter module to reduce trainable parameters. Subsequently, the GAN-BERT model, inspired by 'GAN-BERT for Automated Essay Scoring,' comprises a Discriminator (D) and Generator (G), with G1 mapping noise to vector representations and G2 being a pretrained BERT model. Both generators are trained adversarially alongside D.
