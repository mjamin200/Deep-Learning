## Assignment 1: Review of Essential ML Concepts

The first assignment for this course is focused on reviewing essential machine learning concepts. It serves as a foundational exercise to ensure a strong understanding of the core principles and techniques used in machine learning.

In this assignment, I have completed a series of theoretical questions and practical coding tasks. The coding tasks cover topics such as implementing decision trees, dimensionality reduction with PCA, and solving classification problems using various algorithms. The datasets used include MNIST and the Heart Disease Dataset.

## Assignment 4: RNNs,LSTM,VAEs,AEs,GPT2
This exercise covered a diverse range of deep learning models, including RNN, BiLSTM, LSTM, autoencoder, and sequence-to-sequence models, in four distinct questions.

The initial investigation applied LSTM, BiLSTM, and FC models to molecular strings (SMIELS), evaluating their accuracy at varying string lengths. The second question implemented Convolutional Variational Autoencoder and Variational Autoencoder networks on the MNIST dataset, focusing on the examination of the latent layer's output, particularly in the case of two dimensions. Moving on, the third question involved fine-tuning the HooshvareLab/gpt2-fa model on Ferdowsi's poems, resulting in the generation of poetic samples. Finally, the fourth question implemented Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders, testing the model on both the MNIST dataset and its color version while exploring variations in codebook vectors.
