## Introduction
This README provides an overview of Assignment #1 in the Deep Learning course. The assignment includes both theory questions and coding tasks related to machine learning concepts.

## Assignment Overview
- This assignment serves as an introduction to deep learning and reviews fundamental machine learning concepts.
- It consists of theory questions and three coding tasks that cover the topics of Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, implementing the Decision Tree (ID3) algorithm from scratch, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Theory Questions
- The assignment includes a set of theory questions to evaluate your understanding of basic machine learning concepts. These questions are designed to refresh your knowledge of fundamental principles.

## Code Tasks
The assignment contains three coding tasks:
1. **SVM Implementation**: Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to solve a specific problem.
2. **Logistic Regression**: Create a logistic regression model to solve a classification problem.
3. **Decision Tree (ID3) from Scratch**: Implement the ID3 algorithm to build a decision tree from scratch.
4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Apply Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset.

## Topics
The coding tasks cover the following topics:
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree (ID3) from scratch
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
