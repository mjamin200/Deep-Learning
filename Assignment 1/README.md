# Deep Learning Assignment 1 - Review of Essential ML Concepts

## Overview

This assignment covers foundational machine learning concepts and tasks, including:

- Theoretical questions on probability, linear regression, logistic regression, inequalities
- Decision tree implementation from scratch (ID3 algorithm)
- PCA for dimensionality reduction 
- Classification with Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM

Datasets used: MNIST, Heart Disease 

## Theory Questions

The theory questions assess understanding of key ML concepts:

- Naive Bayes and conditional independence 
- Linear regression model error 
- Logistic regression formulation for multi-class classification
- Regression coefficient derivations
- Markov and Chebyshev inequalities
- Matrix inversion using SVD

## Code Tasks 

The coding portion is divided into 3 problems:

### Problem 1: Decision Tree ID3

- Implement ID3 algorithm to build decision tree on MNIST dataset
- Assess model accuracy

### Problem 2: PCA and Classification

- Perform PCA on MNIST 
- Classify reduced MNIST dataset using Random Forest and Logistic Regression
- Evaluate model performance

### Problem 3: SVM Classification

- Classify heart disease dataset using SVM with linear, RBF, and polynomial kernels
- Tune hyperparameters (gamma for RBF, degree for polynomial) 
- Report accuracy, precision, recall, F1 scores
