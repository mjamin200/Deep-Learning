## Theory Questions

In this section, we reviewed fundamental machine learning concepts. This part of the assignment is designed to ensure a solid understanding of the basics before diving into practical coding tasks. You can provide more details about the theory questions and the specific topics covered.

## Code Tasks

The coding portion of the assignment is divided into three problems, each addressing a different aspect of machine learning.

### Problem 1: Implementing Decision Tree ID3

In this task, you'll implement the ID3 decision tree algorithm from scratch. The dataset used for this problem is MNIST. This problem serves as a foundational exercise in decision tree algorithms.

### Problem 2: PCA and Classification with Random Forest and Logistic Regression

This task focuses on dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and solving classification problems with two different algorithms: Random Forest and Logistic Regression. The dataset used is still MNIST.

### Problem 3: Classification with SVM

The third problem involves classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernel functions (linear, RBF, and polynomial). The dataset used for this problem is the Heart Disease Dataset.
