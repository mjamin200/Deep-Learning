# Deep Learning Assignment 3 - Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview

This assignment focuses on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for computer vision tasks. It includes both theory and coding portions.

## Topics  

- CNN architectures like ResNet
- Advanced techniques like deformable convolutions   
- Change detection between images
- Training strategies and loss functions

## Theory Questions

The theory questions cover fundamental concepts of CNNs, and explore networks like:

- Densely Connected CNNs - Their connectivity pattern and advantages
- U-Net - Architecture and application in segmentation  
- Skip connections in ResNet - How they address vanishing gradients
- Deformable convolutions - Modeling geometric transformations

## Coding Tasks

1. Implement and evaluate ResNet-50 on CIFAR-10 with different loss functions
2. Build deformable convolutional networks from scratch and analyze performance
3. Detect changes between image pairs using a CNN model

For each task, I will provide details on the dataset, model architecture, training procedure, and analyses.
