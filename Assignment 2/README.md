## Theory Problems

### Regularization

In the [Theory](/Theory) directory, you will find detailed solutions to regularization problems. This includes explanations, equations, and any relevant code snippets.

### MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)

The [Theory](/Theory) directory also covers theory problems related to Multi-Layer Perceptrons. Detailed answers, mathematical formulations, and any accompanying code can be found here.

### Optimization

The optimization section in [Theory](/Theory) addresses theoretical problems related to optimization techniques in deep learning. Solutions and relevant code are provided.

## Implementation

### Multi-Layer Neural Network

The [Implementation](/Implementation) directory contains the code for building a Multi-Layer Neural Network from scratch. The implementation is structured and well-documented to facilitate understanding.

- **File Structure:**
  - `multilayer_neural_network.py`: Python script containing the implementation of the neural network.
  - `example_usage.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating how to use the implemented neural network.

### Forward Propagation Algorithm

The [Implementation](/Implementation) directory also includes the implementation of the forward propagation algorithm based on the paper by Geoffrey Hinton.

- **File Structure:**
  - `forward_propagation_geoffrey_hinton.py`: Python script with the forward propagation algorithm.
  - `example_usage.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating the usage of the forward propagation algorithm.

## Usage

For the implementation, follow the examples provided in the `example_usage.ipynb` notebooks. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
