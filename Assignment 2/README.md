# Theoretical Problems

In the Theoretical problems, you'll find explanations and solutions for regularization, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), and optimization in deep learning. The regularization part includes practical solutions and explanations. The MLP section covers the theory behind Multi-Layer Perceptrons with straightforward answers and mathematical explanations. Additionally, the optimization part discusses theoretical challenges related to optimizing deep learning models, offering insights into effective training techniques.


## Implementation

### Multi-Layer Neural Network

I implemented a Multi-Layer Neural Network from scratch, incorporating the Adam and SGD optimization algorithms, along with dropout for enhanced performance. The implementation is structured and well-documented to facilitate understanding.

- `fully_connected_networks.py`: Python script containing the neural network implementation.
- `fully_connected_networks.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating the usage of the neural network implementation.

### Forward Propagation Algorithm

The [Implementation](/Implementation) directory also includes the implementation of the forward propagation algorithm based on the paper by Geoffrey Hinton.

- **File Structure:**
  - `forward_propagation_geoffrey_hinton.py`: Python script with the forward propagation algorithm.
  - `example_usage.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook demonstrating the usage of the forward propagation algorithm.

## Usage

For the implementation, follow the examples provided in the `example_usage.ipynb` notebooks. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.

## Acknowledgments
