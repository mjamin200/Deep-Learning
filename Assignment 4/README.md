## Questions 

### Question 1: Molecular String Analysis

In this question, three models—LSTM, BiLSTM, and FC—were applied to molecular strings (SMIELS). The models' accuracy was evaluated at different lengths of the strings.

### Question 2: Convolutional Variational Autoencoder

Convolutional Variational Autoencoder and Variational Autoencoder networks were implemented and tested on the MNIST dataset. The output of the latent layer, specifically in the case of two dimensions, was examined.

### Question 3: Fine-tuning GPT-2 Model for Poetry

The pre-trained HooshvareLab/gpt2-fa model was fine-tuned on Ferdowsi's poems. Several poetry samples were generated using the fine-tuned model.

### Question 4: Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders

The Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoders network was implemented based on a paper. The model was tested on the MNIST dataset and its color version. The model was also examined with different numbers and dimensions of the codebook vectors.
